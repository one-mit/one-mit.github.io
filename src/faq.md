# FAQ & Search Tips
    
**Search tips:**
- **Leave out any periods, commas, or apostrophes.**
- **Why is my name not showing up in the list?**  
Try refining your search by typing in both the first and last name. Use full names instead of nicknames, e.g. "William" instead of "Bill." 
- **Can't find an alum by the name they went by as a student?**  
If a person has changed their name since graduation, try searching by the name they are known by now. Sometimes name spellings change as well, e.g., "Joerg" instead of "Jorg."
- **Why is nothing showing up as I zoom in?**  
Names are loaded as vector tiles at higher zoom levels, but it might take a few moments.

**Q: Which categories of the MIT community are included on the wafers and can be found by searching the site?**

- Most currently matriculated students (as of September 2023 for the most recent design)
- Most postdoctoral associates and fellows (as of September 2023 for the most recent design)
- Faculty (as of September 2023 for the most recent design)

**Q: What order are the names in?**  
The names are in pseudo-random order. Read more about why <a href="./design-process">here.</a>

**Q: Why is the number of names increasing each time?**  
Every year MIT welcomes new students, staff, and faculty to join the community! We also take the opportunity with each new design to fix errors and add names previously missed - often discovered with the help of visitors like you.

**Q: Who designed One.MIT?**  
MIT Professor W. Craig Carter leads the artistic vision and intricate mathematical designs for every version of One.MIT. Learn more about his design process <a href="./design-process">here</a>.

**Q: How is the wafer made?**  
Each wafer is fabricated right in MIT.nano cleanrooms on campus, with assistance from MIT undergrad students! Learn more about wafer fabrication <a href="./wafer-fabrication">here</a>.

**Q: How is the website made?**  
George Varnavides wrote the code for the website. The 2018 version uses precomputed images at different magnifications. The 2020 and 2024 versions use vector tiles to implement a navigation-like interface. Learn more about the name search implementation <a href="./name-search">here</a>.

**Q: Will you be adding new students/faculty/staff and recent graduate names?**  
We have not settled on a definite plan for adding in recent graduates and new faculty/staff, but we're planning to generate a new version every couple years.
