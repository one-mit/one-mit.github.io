# FAQ & Search Tips
    
**Search tips:**
- **Leave out any periods, commas, or apostrophes.**
- **Why is my name not showing up in the list?** Try refining your search by typing in both the first and last name. Use full names instead of nicknames, e.g. "William" instead of "Bill."
- **Can't find an alum by the name they went by as a student?** If a person has changed their name since graduation, try searching by the name they are known now.
- **Why is nothing showing up as I zoom in?** Names are loaded as vector tiles at higher zoom levels, but it might take a few moments.
