**Q: Why is my name not showing up in the list?**

- Leave out any periods, commas, or apostrophes.
- Try refining your search by typing in both the first and last name.
- Use full names instead of nicknames, e.g. "William" instead of "Bill."
- If a person has changed their name since graduation, try searching by the name they are known by now. Sometimes name spellings change as well, e.g., "Joerg" instead of "Jorg."

MIT alum Georgios Varnavides implemented the name-search functionality.
